|`WordBank` class completed. See JAVADOC comments for details of each the class, main method, helper methods and constructor. The only method of `WordBank` that should be referenced is `getGameWord()`, which is the main method, as all of the other ones are helper methods. However, I make each method public so if we need to use one of the helper methods later down the road we can.  
| I also created a "test_files" folder under java/csci3320/thegallows and within it included `TestWordBank`. This was the class that I used to test the `WordBank` class to verify that `getGameWord()` was returning the correct results. Each helper method was also tested in `TestWordBank`. Nothing needs to be done with this class, but I included it in case we need to perform additional testing on the functionality of `WordBank` in the future.
| I created a folder under main called "assets" which contains four .txt files: "easy.txt", "medium.txt", "hard.txt" and "freeplay.txt". Each file has been populated with some words, however whether the words are valid for their associated difficulty level or not is not certain, so once we get the program working we'll have to review these libraries. "freeplay.txt" is simply a copy of the words in each file. I may modify the code of `getGameWord()` at a later point in time to select randomly from any other three other files to eliminate the redundancy of an aggregate file.
| With the completion of `WordBank` and the population of the .txt difficulty libraries, the word generation feature of the `Gameplay` class can now be implemented. In `Gameplay`, to retrieve a word for a game, a new `WordBank` object must be created: `WordBank newWordBank = new WordBank(difficulty)`, where `difficulty` is an object of type String that can contain only the following Strings: "EASY", "MEDIUM", "HARD" or "FREEPLAY". I have not implemented error handling in `WordBank`, so we need to be sure we code the app to pass the correct constructor arguments to `WordBank`. |
|I also tried to create a layout for the `Gameplay` activity (see `activity_gameplay.xml`). I've created the keyboard and plan on implementing the section of the screen where the words and the blanks display. That is, there is a `GridLayout` where half is dedicated to the "word area" and the other half dedicated to the timer, keyboard, and hangman animation. This "word area" will contain an interface that uses `WordBank`. I am going to try to get the word to appear in the `Gameplay` activity by before class on Tuesday. |

|--------------------------------|
|'StartScreen' and 'Endgame' classes were implemented. On `StartScreen`, there are now four buttons, four the three difficulty levels and Freeplay. In `StartScreen` the difficulty level is passed to the `Gameplay` class via an `Intent`. When the user presses a button on `StartScreen`, this `Intent` starts the `Gameplay` activity. The `Gameplay` activity then accesses the difficulty passed via `getIntent().getStringExtra("Difficulty")`. |
| Similarly, the `Endgame` class has been implemented with two buttons: "Play Again" and "Change Difficulty". If the "Play Again" button is pressed, the previous difficulty is passed back into the `Gameplay` activity and that activity is reinstantiated. If the "Change Difficulty" button is pressed, the user is taken back to the `StartScreen` activity where they can reselect the difficulty mode. |

|--------------------------------|
|Significant changes were made since my last commit. First off, the layout of the `Gameplay` activity in activity_gameplay.xml was redone completely. The layout is actually now more simple: the keyboard is in the QWERTY form and on the bottom of the screen, with the Word Area directly above it. On top of the Word Area will be the hangman picture/animation. I put an `ImageView` widget in the 'ScrollView` container above the Word Area container, anticipating an image to be placed there.|
|The `Gameplay` class was implemented in Java. All items from activity_gameplay.xml are now instantiated in the `Gameplay` class. A dynamically generated `TableLayout` was implemented inside the Word Area container in order to display the letters of the WORD with a bar underneath. Each word and associated underline is in a single cell of the table. In the code, it is defined for the first row to be dedicated to the various letters of the WORD, and the second row simply contains two _ characters. The characters in each cell are made possible by a `TextView`. The letter characters are initially made the same color as the background to appear invisible to the user. Once the user starts selecting buttons, the buttons will become invisible and if the correct button is selected the procedure `updateAllOccurrences()` goes through an array of `TextView` objects and determines if the letter associated with the pressed button is in one of those `TextView` objects. The `updateAllOccurrences()` exists simply to make sure multiple occurrences of letters are made visible to the user instead of just one. Lastly, a `GameOver` method was called if the number of attempts (6) were exceeded indicating a lost game, or if the the number of attempts was 6 or less and the number of succeeded tries is equal to the number of characters in the WORD, indicating a win. The `Gameplay` activity is ended with initiating an Intent that passes the win/loss status, WORD, and current difficulty to the `Endgame` activity.|
|The `WordBank` class was also modified due to some interesting discoveries. Since `WordBank` is a class not extending `Activity`, the application `Context` must be a parameter in its constructor. The reason for needing the application `Context` is due to the fact that files in the assets folder of the project cannot directly be accessed by file path. The method `getAssets()` must be used to reference the file. Therefore, slight changes to the methods were made. Particularly, the `getFileLength()` method was simplified a significant amount by simply iterating the `readLine()` member method until null.|
